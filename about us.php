<p>
<strong>U.A.A.R. Book Store</strong> was established in 1961, and has come a long way since its inception. We have diversified our bookseller base to become a complete one-stop solution for book lovers, and have also gained sole distributorship in Pakistan for some of the best-known books and series in the world.</p>
<p>
With a repertoire of retail outlets to its credit, U.A.A.R has managed to acquire the unprecedented status of being the largest, growing chain of bookstores in Pakistan.</p>
<p>
We have an enthusiastic staff, well-versed with books, who are dedicated to provide customers with flawless services once they are inside the store. Our shops have a homely, vibrant feel, with comfortable seating for people who want to sit and browse through books! Membership of the “U.A.A.R Book Club” can enable customers to earn points and avail discounts on all the latest publications.</p>
<p>
Customers, who cannot avail the benefit of our retail stores, should definitely not feel alienated. Our online store is just as vast and dynamic as our bookstores, where we regularly keep our customers abreast of all the new books. Searching for books can be quite a laborious task, especially when having to do so from a colossal range like ours, but we have categorized our collection, so that browsing is not only convenient, but also fun! We deliver books free of cost all across Pakistan! (Please refer to the payment method page for the cities where this service is valid). Payment Method.</p>
<p>
We have also taken to social media; namely Facebook. With round-the-clock insights on books; interesting promotions; and lively artwork, our page is a virtual sanctuary where any book lover would like to retreat into.</p>
<p>
We have a strong rapport with well-known Pakistani and international writers and team up with them for book signings, story reading sessions and the like. In the past, acclaimed writers like Musharraf Ali Farooqi, Bina Shah, Mohammed Hanif etc, have been part of our events and our collaborative efforts with them have always culminated in success.</p>
<p>
We invite suggestions and feedback, which would allow us to improve our services! Feel free to share if you have any. </p>
